"""Helpers for attaching Arkady metadata to OpenAI chat/responses requests.

OpenAI's ``chat.completions.create`` and ``responses.create`` accept a
``metadata`` field (a string-to-string map) that — when the account has
Stored Completions enabled — surfaces in the Usage Dashboard, enabling
per-app filtering. Constraints, from the OpenAI API reference:

  Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. Keys are
  strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
  a maximum length of 512 characters.

Unlike Bedrock or Vertex, OpenAI does not document a character pattern
restriction on metadata values, so ``normalize_metadata_value`` only
enforces string coercion and the 512-character length cap.

The OpenAI API only accepts ``metadata`` when ``store`` is true — it
rejects the request with ``BadRequestError: The 'metadata' parameter is
only allowed when 'store' is enabled.`` otherwise. Enabling this feature
therefore inherently requires ``store=true``, so
``apply_arkady_metadata_if_enabled`` sets it alongside the metadata. This
means requests and responses are persisted to Stored Completions on the
OpenAI account; the credential's help text documents that storage
behavior. An explicit ``store`` value already present on the request is
respected rather than overwritten.
